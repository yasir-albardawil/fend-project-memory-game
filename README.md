# Memory Game Project

## What is the Memory Game
**Matching games** are [games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game "Game") that require players to match similar elements. As the name implies, participants need to find a match for a word, picture, or card. For example, students place 30 word cards; composed of 15 pairs, face down in random order. Each person turns over two cards at a time, with the goal of turning over a matching pair, by using their memory. This is also known as the Pelmanism principle, after Christopher Louis Pelman, a British psychologist of the first half of the 20th century.

### Project Specification

-   The game randomly shuffles the cards. Player wins once all cards have successfully been matched.
-   When a player wins the game, a modal appears for congratulations and asks for one more game. It tells the player how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.
-   A restart button allows the player to reset the game board at any time of the game: the timer, and the star rating.
-   The game displays a star rating (from 1 to at least 3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display at least 3 stars. After some number of moves, it should change to a lower star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a even lower star rating (down to 1).
-   When the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
-   Game displays the current number of moves a user has made.

### Game Description
The player must flip 16 randomly placed cards, 2 at a time, to find pairs of cards. The player wins the game once all cards have been matched. The game tracks the player's time and number of moves, and gives the player a number of stars between 1 and 3, based on performance (number of moves, where flipping 2 cards counts as 1 move).

#### Challenge
Match cards in less time with less moves.

### How to play
Make moves on the table of cards by choosing pairs of cards that you think that have the same symbols. If the cards match, they will remain open. If they do not match, they will flip over and you can try again.
